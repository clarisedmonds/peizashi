                            <p> Article: https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/youtube-tv-available-nationwide/. Hallo, amp#x200B; I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results. I have gapps-config running to my very delight but there's some more I'd like to do after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file. It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended Unlocked Bootloader, had a guy do it, used Magisk. Magisk kept asking for update, and I think my daughter approved, now I get this: amp#x200B; dropbox.com/s/12iuq18yimovmx9/image1001.jpg amp#x200B; Would really appreciate some insight. 
How come google doesn't release a docker image for android? thanks. https://hub.docker.com/r/thyrlian/android-sdk/\~/dockerfile/ (https://hub.docker.com/r/thyrlian/android-sdk/~/dockerfile/). The "full" installer of Android Studio downloads a bunch of things and then downloads a bunch of things after having downloaded a bunch of things. I need to be able to reconstruct the toolchain environment in the future without relying on external resources to build then dated projects. How would one go about preserving everything? Thank you in advance! Edit: Thank you for the replies. My current conclusion is that there is no clean way as of today. I posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/An. Ever since I got Redmi 4X, I've wanted to try out a different rom other than the MIUI. We now have unofficial release of third party rom developments such as Lineage, Resurrection Remix etc. for this device. I want to try out Resurrection Remix rom but I got some questions regarding this which I hope will be answered by the kind users here. Question 1: The installation requires firmware update if the phone is running on Android 6. I don't understand how to use the update zip folder When I sudo apt-get install android-tools, I get package not found. When I try to force install it via a deb package, I get library dependency errors. Samsung Chromebook 3; running xfce4 on (I believe) precise. Am I missing something. and create my own custom rom? i tried to delete audiofx and created a .zip file but it produced an error. how can i edit lineageos Hello, i bought callbar for ios 10 but is transparent and i dont know why, can you help me bring back the color. So I can't edit my SpringBoard apps. Well I can, but a few minutes/hours later they are back as they were before I changed them. Seems unclear what triggers them, but atleast after a install/remove of apps, a respring/reboot and a longer period of time (like the cache is outting the icons back). I reinstalled tweaks like AppList and IconSupport, doesn't seem to help. Full tweaklist in comments. Thanks for ur help in advance. For the longest time I have not been able to enable Location Services. I can navigate to ththe location services settings pane and "enable" it, but as soon as I leave that pane, it switches back to off. I don't have any tweaks that I believe would conflict with this. I will post a tweaks Anyone can maybe enlighten me on which tweaks could be draining my battery so fast? http://imgur.com/e9Lwikz. 
I know im about to sound like a total noob here but i just wanted to tell everyone who wasnt aware that having dropbox installed might be one of the best decisions i have made this week. i used to hate plug in in my nook to my computer and then clicking and dragging through file menus to add the zips and apks to my nc. but dropbox made it so easy. and on top of that i don't have to worry about my flash drive anymore when i need docs for class tl;dr Dropbox is awesome. I've tried flashing via CyanDelta and via the download in the built in full updater - it just gets to the Google image and doesn't get to the CyanogenMod boot image. I flashed back to 7-21 and it loads no problem. Any ideas. So you are on US unlocked and are sick of seeing everyone else get updates before you? Well fret not as there is an easy method to get updates as soon as they are available. No need to wipe data, have carrier bloatware, tethering limitations, doesnt matter which carrier you already use, and keep receiving OTA updates. What we will do use the is use the Sprint's unlocked firmware variant (which is almost always the first to get the updates) to update the generic unlocked firmware (which I created this system to be an exhaustive classification of all types of software. There were certain places like 3D modeling software where I don't have a full understanding of how it works so any feedback would be appreciated. I have a course where I explain how the categories work and you can download a zip of a ll the folders already created if you want to plug this in to your system. I've pasted a text version of all the folders below from the zip. You can access the course for free using. \ Edit: added warning in step 3 after flashing Nougat. Thank u/Unchanged\- and u/protagonest for this solution!\ \ Edit 2: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PLATINUM I AM TRULY WITHOUT WORDS.\ Hey guys! Thought this would be a nice thing to create here on reddit for all my fellow V30 users!This is a semi-comprehensive guide on unlocking your bootloader, rooting, and flashing LineageOS 16. Note: This is a time-consuming process, and some of the files download rather slow and are quite large. Im not seeing a lot of full detailed posts about the head units and they would have swayed my choice either way. so here is mine. there is a TL;DR at the bottom and my general conclusion here:For the price you pay, its pretty good, that being said, other known brands (Kenwood, Sony, Panasonic) would blow this out of the water in terms of quality. I ordered from the Eonon website, and it did not instill confidence in what i was buying. i spent about a week double and triple checking </p>
