                            <p> # Essential Software for Windows 10 This is a list of software I found useful. This list is designed around Windows 10; many of these should work with older Windows, Linux distros, and Mac. This is a list of software I've personally tried and tested, there may be better ones out there so keep your calm when your favorite software isn't featured. Suggestions are always welcomed. This is my last post on /r/software, form now on I'll maintain a repo to keep this list updated. Message Note: The content is a mirror to a gist on Github (https://gist.github.com/laggardkernel/4a4c4986ccdcaf47b91e8227f9868ded). But I'll try to keep the post in sync with the gist. Leave your reply at either place is okay. ## Changelog update 1: add a FAQ section update 2: benchmark chart and feature comparison table ## TLDR Speed comparison of ZSH plugin mangers with 10 plugins loaded (https://github.com/vintersnow/zsh_plugin_manager_speed) made by vintersnow@github, detail is covered.

This is the seventh and final thread. Damn son, it's been three years already. I am finished providing technical support for this VN.

Hey all, I need a laptop for college. I'm a CS major and my last shitty Lenovo laptop snapped at its plastic hinges gt:( so I need a new one for my last two years of college. I've done some research, especially on here but I'd like any suggestions in case I missed a better deal. Thanks.
