                            <p> Pretty busy game release week as devs try to sneak out their games before Red Dead Redemption 2 next week.

On last week's Warrior's Den, the head of the Fight Team, Stefan Jewinski joined The Pope to talk about the state of balance in For Honor currently, and update the community about what the Fight Team are working on. He also undertook a QampA answering some questions from the community, mostly from the megathread on the main subreddit.
