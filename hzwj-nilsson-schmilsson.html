Hi guys, I have a problem with the RSD edition of the record. It seems to hit a patch of static, some kind of scuff at the beginning of both sides. I was really careful with it and didn't touch the surface at any point when I played it for the first time, the problem remains after I cleaned the record. It also seems to hit pretty much where the color changes. I want to know it someone else who grabbed the same record has the same problem or if there is any solution before I contact the store.
