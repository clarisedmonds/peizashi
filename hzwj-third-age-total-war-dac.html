Hi guys, I'm playing Third Age total war Divide and Conquer and I'm having some trouble as Isengard. I've gotten the ring with Saruman and put him in Isengard for many many turns, yet I still didn't get the Isengard ring event that's supposed to be a choice or something.

Please share any particularly epic moments when your brave soldiers went well beyond the call of duty, whether it be a sacrificial rearguard action, forming a square to duke it out to the last man, whatever comes to mind.
